'''
make robot moves in a straight line, and stops when the closest obstacles become at a distance less than 0.6 meters.
Use a laser bean around the center of [-5,+5] degrees.
Then, develop another function that makes the robot rotates until the straight obstacle distance in the same beam aperture becomes greater than 3 meters.
Make a loop to repeat these two functions and observe if the robot succeeds to move without hitting the obstacle forever or not.
